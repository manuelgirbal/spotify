### (Currently building a shiny app with playlist analytics on top of the Spotify API)

-   With this script ("lists.R") you'll be able to store your Spotify playlists as .csv files. The only prerequisite is to go to [https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/](https://www.spotify.com/ar/account/privacy/){.uri} and ask for a copy of your account's data. It should be given to you in a day or two.
