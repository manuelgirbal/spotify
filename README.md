# spotify

-   Run the [app](https://github.com/manuelgirbal/spotify/tree/main/spotify_app) locally to create new playlists based on your existing ones using k-means algorithm. You'll have to create a "credentials.R" file in the app directory containing a client_id and client_secret. To get them, please go to https://developer.spotify.com/, create a developer account and a new project, with which you can generate the credentials and register the Redirect URI.

-   With the "lists.R" you'll be able to store your Spotify playlists as .csv files. The only prerequisite is to go to [https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/](https://www.spotify.com/ar/account/privacy/) and ask for a copy of your account's data. It should be given to you in a day or two.
